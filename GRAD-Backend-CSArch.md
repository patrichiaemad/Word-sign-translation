**Introduction:**

This report outlines the development and implementation of a sign language translator system using a client-server architecture. The system enables users to capture videos of sign language gestures, which are then sent to the server for evaluation using a pre-trained machine learning model.

The server saves the video and prediction in a database and returns the model's prediction to the client. Additionally, the client app allows users to provide feedback on the accuracy of the predictions, which can be utilized to further train and improve the model.

**1.1 Client Application:**

The client application provides a user-friendly interface for capturing sign language gestures through video recording. It facilitates the communication between the user and the server backend. After capturing a video, the client app sends it to the server for processing and evaluation. The app also enables users to provide feedback on the accuracy of the model's predictions.

**1.2 Server Backend:**

The server backend is responsible for processing the received videos, evaluating them using the pre-trained model, and storing relevant data in a database.

Upon receiving a video from the client, the server extracts the relevant features from the video frames and feeds them into the machine learning model for prediction.

The server saves the video, prediction, and any feedback received from users into a database for further analysis and model improvement.

*Rationale for Client-Server Architecture:*
The decision to adopt a client-server architecture for the sign language translator system was based on several factors:

**2.1 Scalability:**

A client-server architecture allows for scalable deployment of the system. Multiple clients can connect to the server simultaneously, enabling a large number of users to access the translation service without compromising performance or responsiveness.

**2.2 Centralized Processing:**

By offloading the video processing and prediction tasks to the server backend, the client application can remain lightweight and efficient. The server, equipped with higher computational resources, can handle the computationally intensive tasks required for sign language gesture recognition.

**2.3 Data Storage and Analysis:**

The server's ability to save videos, predictions, and user feedback in a centralized database is crucial for data analysis and model improvement. The accumulated data can be utilized to retrain the machine learning model periodically, enhancing its accuracy and expanding its vocabulary of recognized sign language gestures.

**2.4 Modularity and Updates:**

The client-server architecture allows for modular development and updates. The server backend, hosting the machine learning model, can be updated independently without affecting the client application. This flexibility enables future enhancements, such as incorporating more advanced models or incorporating new features into the system.

**Conclusion:**

The adoption of a client-server architecture in the development of the sign language translator system offers numerous benefits, including scalability, centralized processing, efficient data storage and analysis, and modularity for future updates. This architecture ensures an effective and scalable solution for sign language translation, enabling users to communicate seamlessly by bridging the gap between sign language and spoken language through the power of technology. The integration of user feedback into the training process further enhances the accuracy and performance of the system, making it an invaluable tool for the sign language community.
